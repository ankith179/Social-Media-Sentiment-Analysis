Using Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I conducted an analysis on a dataset comprising 50,000 tweets. The first step involved preprocessing the text data, which included tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.

After preprocessing, I focused on analyzing the impact of hashtags on tweet sentiment. To do this, I used Seaborn, a Python data visualization library, to create visualizations that illustrate how different hashtags correlate with tweet sentiment. This allowed for a deeper understanding of which topics or themes tended to elicit positive or negative sentiment among Twitter users.

Next, I applied various machine learning models to predict the sentiment of tweets. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the models on the training data, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

After evaluating the performance of multiple models, I selected the best-performing model based on its F1-score, which is a metric that balances both precision and recall. The chosen model was then used for sentiment prediction on new or unseen tweets.

Overall, this analysis leveraged text mining, NLP techniques, data visualization, and machine learning to gain insights into tweet sentiment and develop a predictive model for sentiment analysis.
